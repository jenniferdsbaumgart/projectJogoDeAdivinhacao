# Guessing Game - Java

This is a basic guessing game implemented in Java. It's my first contact with this language, where I used concepts such as user input, random number generation, and basic control flow.

## Project Overview

In this game:

- The program asks the user for their name.
- It then asks if the user wants to play the guessing game.
- If the user agrees, the program picks a random number between 0 and 10, and the     user must guess it.
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
## How the Game Works

- The user is asked for their name and whether they want to play.
-If the user chooses to play, a random number between 0 and 10 is generated by the program.
- The user keeps guessing until they correctly guess the number.
- The program gives feedback whether the guess is correct or wrong.


## Tech Stack

**Java**: The programming language used to build the game.
**Scanner**: For capturing user input.
**Random**: For generating random numbers.
## How to Run

1. Copy the code to a .java file (e.g., Jogo.java).
2. Compile the Java code using the following command:

```bash
  javac Jogo.java
```

3. Run the compiled program:

```bash
  java Jogo
```
